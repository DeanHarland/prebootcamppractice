# prebootcamppractice
This repo is for practicing fullstack

## Week 1:

### Day1:
Today I created a plan with the help of Chat gpt to get in practice before the bootcamp. This is in hopes of not being overwhelmed by the bootcamp and better understand it.
As I've dabbled in html before I started by creating a basic portfolio site just from the things I remembered. It was hard remembering alot of it but a quick google search for the correct inputs was effective. I finished the day off by adding very basic CSS to it. It was a basic site with a color pallete so a success none the less.

### Day2:
Today I felt very unsure on my CSS as yesterdays project was very unappealing so with the help of ChatGPT, I asked it to give me several tasks to work on regarding CSS. It mainly was Flex boxs and grids. This felt like a productive day as it was the first time i was properly and effectively using ChatGPT as a learning tool.

### Day3:
Today I carried on with the practice tasks set by ChatGPT. It invloved finishing up creating a basic, pro and premium pricing plan, each with its own colors and sitting nicely next to each other. I created 2 of the same pricing plan, 1 using Flex box and 1 using grid. I then moved onto working with transition and making my project more appealing. Creating a profile card that expanded when hoverd on aswell as a loading/progress bar that filled up. After this I used what I learnt today to improve the projects section of my portfolio project.
I'm still a lot of practice with positions, so tomorrow I will aim to practice this.
