# prebootcamppractice
This repo is for practicing fullstack

## Week 1:

### Day1:
Today I created a plan with the help of Chat gpt to get in practice before the bootcamp. This is in hopes of not being overwhelmed by the bootcamp and better understand it.
As I've dabbled in html before I started by creating a basic portfolio site just from the things I remembered. It was hard remembering alot of it but a quick google search for the correct inputs was effective. I finished the day off by adding very basic CSS to it. It was a basic site with a color pallete so a success none the less.

### Day2:
Today I felt very unsure on my CSS as yesterdays project was very unappealing so with the help of ChatGPT, I asked it to give me several tasks to work on regarding CSS. It mainly was Flex boxs and grids. This felt like a productive day as it was the first time i was properly and effectively using ChatGPT as a learning tool.

### Day3:
Today I carried on with the practice tasks set by ChatGPT. It invloved finishing up creating a basic, pro and premium pricing plan, each with its own colors and sitting nicely next to each other. I created 2 of the same pricing plan, 1 using Flex box and 1 using grid. I then moved onto working with transition and making my project more appealing. Creating a profile card that expanded when hoverd on aswell as a loading/progress bar that filled up. After this I used what I learnt today to improve the projects section of my portfolio project.
I still need a lot of practice with positions, so tomorrow I will aim to practice this.

### Day4:
I started off today by completing 7 css postitioning tasks set by ChatGPT, it made alot more sense after completing them. However using the effectivley in my projects is still hard, I think im missing something. After this I decided I would do another project to put everything i've learnt together. I landed on creating a product page for an energy drink called TIGER ENERGY. This went well for the most part and I was able to create each section with relativly ease, my css is still poor though as the site looked bad. It still is an improvment from my portfolio site. I asked chat gpt to help me with the CSS and setttled on a black and orange approach.
I still need practice with css but this will come with time, I will do a few tasks tomorrow to do with css and then move onto javascript so i can get that underway.

### Day 5 (Weekend):
Today I did a few css tasks that focused on making the visuals look better. I decided to do the tasks on my tiger energy site so that it would benifit the site aswell get practice in it. The final task was making a good looking header which actually had me use my first bit of javascript. This was just a simple hamburger navigation when the screen was mobile size. After this I added some readme's to git hub to describe my projects. Now I had started looking into javascript some more, after getting a little overwhelmed i found a css flex box game  called: Flexbox Froggy which I completed. Will carry on learning Javascript tomorrow.

### Day 6 (Weekend):
I went to carry on watching javascript udemy course but I couldnt bring my self to just sit there and watch it. What I did instead was ask chat gpt to walk me through creating a javascript heavy project. A maths quiz. Firstly I created the basic html skeleton aswell as styling it with CSS, only having to look up why it wasnt completly centering(justify-content). I then followed through the javascript code chat gpt showed me, I understood most of it as I've dabbled in languages before, it was just the different terminolgy of things that i had to get used to. After completing a basic version of I was less confused about how javascript works now. Tomorrow I'll go back through and polish off the webapp to practice css and add a few additional functionality bits to it. After wards I'll ask for more practice tasks to do with JS from chat gpt so i can practice without being spoon fed the code.
