# prebootcamppractice
This repo is for practicing fullstack

## Week 1:

### Day1:
Today I created a plan with the help of Chat gpt to get in practice before the bootcamp. This is in hopes of not being overwhelmed by the bootcamp and better understand it.
As I've dabbled in html before I started by creating a basic portfolio site just from the things I remembered. It was hard remembering alot of it but a quick google search for the correct inputs was effective. I finished the day off by adding very basic CSS to it. It was a basic site with a color pallete so a success none the less.

### Day2:
Today I felt very unsure on my CSS as yesterdays project was very unappealing so with the help of ChatGPT, I asked it to give me several tasks to work on regarding CSS. It mainly was Flex boxs and grids. This felt like a productive day as it was the first time i was properly and effectively using ChatGPT as a learning tool.

### Day3:
Today I carried on with the practice tasks set by ChatGPT. It invloved finishing up creating a basic, pro and premium pricing plan, each with its own colors and sitting nicely next to each other. I created 2 of the same pricing plan, 1 using Flex box and 1 using grid. I then moved onto working with transition and making my project more appealing. Creating a profile card that expanded when hoverd on aswell as a loading/progress bar that filled up. After this I used what I learnt today to improve the projects section of my portfolio project.
I still need a lot of practice with positions, so tomorrow I will aim to practice this.

### Day4:
I started off today by completing 7 css postitioning tasks set by ChatGPT, it made alot more sense after completing them. However using the effectivley in my projects is still hard, I think im missing something. After this I decided I would do another project to put everything i've learnt together. I landed on creating a product page for an energy drink called TIGER ENERGY. This went well for the most part and I was able to create each section with relativly ease, my css is still poor though as the site looked bad. It still is an improvment from my portfolio site. I asked chat gpt to help me with the CSS and setttled on a black and orange approach.
I still need practice with css but this will come with time, I will do a few tasks tomorrow to do with css and then move onto javascript so i can get that underway.

### Day 5 (Weekend):
Today I did a few css tasks that focused on making the visuals look better. I decided to do the tasks on my tiger energy site so that it would benifit the site aswell get practice in it. The final task was making a good looking header which actually had me use my first bit of javascript. This was just a simple hamburger navigation when the screen was mobile size. After this I added some readme's to git hub to describe my projects. Now I had started looking into javascript some more, after getting a little overwhelmed i found a css flex box game  called: Flexbox Froggy which I completed. Will carry on learning Javascript tomorrow.

### Day 6 (Weekend):
I went to carry on watching javascript udemy course but I couldnt bring my self to just sit there and watch it. What I did instead was ask chat gpt to walk me through creating a javascript heavy project. A maths quiz. Firstly I created the basic html skeleton aswell as styling it with CSS, only having to look up why it wasnt completly centering(justify-content). I then followed through the javascript code chat gpt showed me, I understood most of it as I've dabbled in languages before, it was just the different terminolgy of things that i had to get used to. After completing a basic version of I was less confused about how javascript works now. Tomorrow I'll go back through and polish off the webapp to practice css and add a few additional functionality bits to it. After wards I'll ask for more practice tasks to do with JS from chat gpt so i can practice without being spoon fed the code.

### Day 7
I cracked on with the mini tasks today. I completed 2 of the mini tasks, counterapp and digital clock. Both made sense and i get into the habit of calling the right items from getdocumentid. I'm also getting used to the use of functions and variables in JS. I also found i keep forgetting to end my lines with ; . My problem solving is still up to date and i'm able to find the problems I encounter pretty quickly. Tomorrow I will carry on with the other 3 tasks and make a plan for bootstrap.

### Day 8
finished off the other 3 JS mini tasks today. I'm getting more confident in what to call and when. I enjoyed making the rock paper scissors game as i got to use lots of if statments. One problem I keep encountering is calling a buttons function on load istead of () => before it. I also created a project and used bootstrap for the first time. It's sad but also funny how much better a good looking css is compared to mine. Tomorrow I think I will go back through the jsmini tasks and make the css look better to get some practice in even though bootstrap is probably going to be the way forward. 

## Day 9 
Today I did some learning on rem, em vh to better under stand them. I then used Chatgpt to work through some python. As i've used it in the past most things seemed familiar and i was easily able to craete a simple to do list. I then decided to follow chatgpt set up and make a python to do list that used postgreSQL. Although I would still need to follow a guide when making another one, I understand the majority of the content put.
